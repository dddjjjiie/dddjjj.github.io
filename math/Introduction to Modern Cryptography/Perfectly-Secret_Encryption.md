# Perfectly-Secret Encryption

### Definition 2.1

An encryption scheme(Gen, Enc, Dec)  over a message space $M$ is perfectly secret if for every probability distribution over $M$, every message $m \in M$, and every ciphertext $c \in C$ for which Pr\[C=c\] \> 0:
$$
Pr[M=m | C=c] = Pr[M=m]
$$
Another way of interpreting Definition 2.1 is that a scheme is perfectly secret if the distributions over messages and ciphertexts are independent.

### Lemma 2.2

An encryption scheme(Gen, Enc, Dec) over a message space $M$ is perfectly secret if and only if for every probability distribution over $M$, every message $m \in M$, and every ciphertext $c \in C$:
$$
Pr[C=c | M=m] = Pr[C=c]
$$

### Lemma 2.3

An encryption scheme(Gen, Enc, Dec) over a message space $M$ is perfectly secret if and only if for every probability distribution over $M$, every $m_0, m_1 \in M$, and every $c \in C$:
$$
Pr[C = c | M = m_0] = Pr[C = c | M = m_1]
$$

### Adversarial indistinguishability

The adversarial indistinguishability experiment $PrivK_{A, \prod}^{eav}$:

1. The adversary A outputs a pair of message $m_0, m_1 \in M$
2. A random key $k$ is generated by running $Gen$, and a random bit $b \leftarrow \{0, 1\}$ is chosen(These are chosen by some imaginary entity that is running the experiment with A). Then, the ciphertext $c \leftarrow Enc_k(m_b)$ is computed and given to A.
3. A output a bit $b'$.
4. The output of the experiment is defined to be 1 if $b'=b$, and 0 otherwise. We write $PrivK_{A, \prod}^{eav} = 1$ if the output is 1 and in this case we say that A succeeded.

### Definition 2.4

An encryption scheme(Gen, Enc, Dec) over a message space $M$ is perfectly secret if for every adversary A it holds that
$$
Pr[PrivK_{A, \prod}^{eav} = 1] = \frac{1}{2}
$$

### Proposition 2.5

Let (Gen, Enc, Dec) be an encryption scheme over a message space $M$. Then, (Gen, Enc, Dec) is perfectly secret with respect to Definition 2.1 if and only if it is perfectly secret with respect to definition 2.4.

### Theorem 2.6

The one-time pad is a perfectly-secret encryption scheme.

### Theorem 2.7

Let (Gen, Enc, Dec) be a perfectly-secret encryption scheme over a message space $M$, and let $K$ be the key space as determined by Gen. Then $|K| \geq |M|$.

### Theorem 2.8

Let (Gen, Enc, Dec) be an encryption scheme over a message space M for which $|M| = |K| = |C|$. This scheme is perfectly secret if and only if:

1. Every key $k \in K$ is chosen with equal probability $1 / |K|$ by algorithm Gen.
2. For every $m \in M$ and every $c \in C$, there exists a single key $k \in K$ such that $Enc_k(m)$ outputs c.
