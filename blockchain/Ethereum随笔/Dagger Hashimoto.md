# Dagger Hashimoto

Dagger Hashimoto was a precursor research implementation and specification for the mining algorithm for Ethereum 1.0.

The difference between Dagger Hashimoto and Hashingmoto is that, instead of using the blockchain as a data source, Dagger Hashimoto uses a custom-generated 1GB data set, which updates based on block data every N blocks. The data set is generated using the Dagger algorithm, allowing for the efficient calculation of a subset specific to every nonce for the light client verification algorithm. The difference between Dagger Hashimoto and Dagger is that, unlike in the original Dagger, the dataset used to query the block is semi-permanet, only being updated at occasional intervals.

## DAG Generation

The code for the algorithm will be defined in Python below. First, we give encode_int for marshaling unsigned ints of specified precision to strings. Its inverse is also given:

```python
NUM_BITS = 512

def encode_int(x):
    "Encode an integer x as a string of 64 characters using a big-endian scheme"
    o = ''
    for _ in range(NUM_BITS / 8):
        o = chr(x % 256) + o
        x //= 256
    return o

def decode_int(s):
    "Unencode an integer x from a string using a big-endian scheme"
    x = 0
    for c in s:
        x *= 256
        x += ord(c)
    return x
```

We next assume that sha3 is a function that takes an integer, and dbl_sha3 is a double-sha3 function; if converting this reference code into an implementation use:

```python
from pyethereum import utils
def sha3(x):
    if isinstance(x, (int, long)):
        x = encode_int(x)
    return decode_int(utils.sha3(x))

def dbl_sha3(x):
    if isinstance(x, (int, long)):
        x = encode_int(x)
    return decode_int(utils.sha3(utils.sha3(x)))
```

### Parameters

The parameters used for the algorithm are:

```python
SAFE_PRIME_512 = 2**512 - 38117     # Largest Safe Prime less than 2**512

params = {
      "n": 4000055296 * 8 // NUM_BITS,  # Size of the dataset (4 Gigabytes); MUST BE MULTIPLE OF 65536
      "n_inc": 65536,                   # Increment in value of n per period; MUST BE MULTIPLE OF 65536
                                        # with epochtime=20000 gives 882 MB growth per year
      "cache_size": 2500,               # Size of the light client's cache (can be chosen by light
                                        # client; not part of the algo spec)
      "diff": 2**14,                    # Difficulty (adjusted during block evaluation)
      "epochtime": 100000,              # Length of an epoch in blocks (how often the dataset is updated)
      "k": 1,                           # Number of parents of a node
      "w": w,                          # Used for modular exponentiation hashing
      "accesses": 200,                  # Number of dataset accesses during hashimoto
      "P": SAFE_PRIME_512               # Safe Prime for hashing and random number generation
}
```

Note that only the latter half of the DAG actually needs to be stored, so the de-facto RAM requirement starts off at 1GB and grows by 441MB per year.

### Dagger graph building

```python
def produce_dag(params, seed, length):
    P = params["P"]
    picker = init = pow(sha3(seed), params["w"], P)
    o = [init]
    for i in range(1, length):
        x = picker = (picker * init) % P
        for _ in range(params["k"]):
            x ^= o[x % i]
        o.append(pow(x, params["w"], P))
    return o
```
